# ![About Zza!](http://www.breezejs.com/sites/all/files/samples/zza-sample.png) About Zza!

**Zza** is an online pizza parlor application 
written as a **Breeze/Angular** single page app (SPA). 

Mostly for realism and partly for lack of imagination, 
much of the logic, layout, pricing, and content were 
borrowed from the web site of a U.S. pizza store chain.

A **nodejs + expres**s server delivers the 
JavaScript, CSS, and HTML templates to the browser while  a **MongoDb database** persists the data.
